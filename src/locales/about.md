# About Us

- "We are people from all over the world, united to tackle trash—on streets, in nature, everywhere."

We are a group of everyday people from Germany, the USA, England, Australia, Spain, and Italy, united by one simple thing: We All Hate Trash. Whether it’s in the city, the park, the countryside, the forest, or on an island; on the street, at the beach, in the sea, the ocean, a lake, or even on a peninsula; at festivals, parties, or stadiums—trash doesn’t belong there, and we’ve had enough of it.
It doesn’t matter where you’re from, how old you are, what you believe, or the color of your skin. We don’t care about your gender, who you love, what you wear, or how you get around—whether you walk, drive, fly, ride, or sail—or even what you eat, how you heat your home, or where you live. What matters is coming together to create a cleaner, brighter future.
WAHT - UNITED is an initiative driven by this shared passion. It’s a movement to unite people everywhere in the fight against rubbish, inspiring action and creating a world we can all be proud of.
We believe a world free of rubbish is worth fighting for. So let’s unite forces and start a movement. Together, we can make a real difference.

## How it started

WAHT began on an ordinary morning, just like so many others. I was out walking with my dog, my special moment of calm no matter where I am. The sun was coming up, lighting up the world with its warm, gentle glow, and everything felt just perfect. But then, as always, my eyes fell on it: trash. A crushed plastic bottle by the roadside. An empty chip bag caught on a bush. And there were all those cigarette butts littering the ground as if they belonged there.

It wasn't just that morning, you know. It's every morning. No matter where I am, be it strolling through a bustling city, wandering along the beaches, or hiking deep into the mountains where nature should remain untouched, I always see rubbish. It's in the woods where I go to, on the shorelines, and even in the countryside.

Every time, it stirs something in me: a feeling of frustration, sadness, and a deep yearning to make it stop.

For years, when I’m at the Côte d'Azur in the south of France or on the beaches of Ibiza, my morning walks with my dog have included a quiet ritual. I'll bend down, pick up any little bits of glass that are on the beach, and put them in my pocket. It started as a small gesture – a way to do my part – but it became a bittersweet habit. Piece by piece, I would collect these shards, their edges softened by the waves, thinking of the stories they carried: broken bottles, careless moments, remnants of disregard.

After six years, I now have a big bag filled with thousands upon thousands of those small, shimmering fragments, each one picked up by hand. They are beautiful, yes, but also a constant reminder of something ugly: they don’t belong there. None of this trash does.

At first, all I felt was anger. Why don't people care? Why do we treat this planet, our home, as if it's disposable? But, you know what? Over time, that anger just melted away, and what was left was this determination to do something about it. I couldn't just shake my head or grumble anymore. I needed to take action.

That's how WAHT—We All Hate Trash—was born. It's not just about picking up trash; it's about creating a movement, a community of people who share this frustration and want to make a difference. I know I'm not alone in feeling this way. There are so many other people out there who feel the same way, who walk through forests, beaches, and cities and feel that pang of sadness and anger. WAHT is a way to bring us together, to turn that frustration into action and make change possible.

So, every time I see a piece of trash, I remind myself why I started WAHT. It's because this world deserves better. We all do. And I truly believe that, together, we can create a cleaner, kinder future.
